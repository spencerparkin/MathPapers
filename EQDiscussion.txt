Power in the Priesthood -- Elder Anderson

Ask: Concerning the role we play as bearers of the priesthood, who are the main beneficiaries of the priesthood and who is the benefactor?

When we're exercising our priesthood, I'm not sure that we land in either of these two categories.

Read paragraph 3.  The main beneficiaries are everyone.

Read paragraph 4.  Those exercising priesthood are not the benefactors, they are the administrators.

It is probably not possible to successfully administer the blessings of the priesthood if we do not understand the principle that Elder Anderson is teaching us in paragraph 4.  When we give priesthood blessings, we are humbly seeking the will of Heavenly FAther, that He may inspire and direct us.

Ask: How do we receive priesthood power and blessings?

Read paragraphs 5-7.

So we receive priesthood blessings by being obedient to covenants we have made in ordinances administered to us by the authority priesthood.

Ask: What are some manifestations of priesthood power and blessings in our lives as we're obedient to our covenants?

Read paragraphs 8-9.

//Ask: Why are priesthood blessings administered exclusively by men in the church?
//
//Read reference 12.

Ask: What set of circumstances must come together in order for there to be a real administration of priesthood blessings from one exercising priesthood authority to one seeking a priesthood blessing?

Read paragraphs 16-17.

(P22 needs highlighting)

It's possible that through disobedience to the law of chastity and other commandments that we may be forfeiting certain spiritual gifts, without which, we cannot administer certain priesthood blessings.  We may then even come under condemnation for failing to give priesthood blessings that we would otherwise have been able to administer.
