we first must give usual metric on R^n as euclidean metric using norm in GA
assume the usual topology on R^n
build up the definition of what will become an integrable surface
define the integral over a surface
show that the integral is well defined (the integral is a function taking
the surface to integrate over and the function to integrate over the surface as arguments)
