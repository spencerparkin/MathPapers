AMS BOOK MONOGRAPH STYLE PACKAGE
--------------------------------

This package contains files to help authors use AMS-LaTeX to prepare a
monograph for publication at the AMS.  We assume that the following
software is installed on your system.

    LaTeX           version 2e, December 1995 or later
    AMS-LaTeX       version 2.0, December 1999 or later
    AMSFonts        version 2.0, January 1995 or later

If you have an older version of LaTeX or AMS-LaTeX, please upgrade,  You
can retrieve the current version of AMS-LaTeX from the AMS web server at

    http://www.ams.org/tex/amslatex.html

We also assume that you are familiar with LaTeX and AMS-LaTeX document
structuring commands such as \section, \footnote, \newtheorem, etc., and
with the techniques for inputting math expressions.

1) This package contains the following files.

general files

    README-M-L.TXT         overview of monograph package (this file)
    instr-l.pdf            Instructions
    handbk.pdf             AMS Author Handbook
    creating-graphics.pdf  Creating graphics for use in books and journals
    amsbook.cls            basis for all monograph-specific document classes

document class file

    *-l.cls           ("*" represents the specific series code)

template file

    chapter-template.tex   monograph topmatter template

sample document files

    chapter.tex       monograph driver file
    preface.tex       preface
    chap1.tex         chapter
    biblio.tex        bibliography
    index.tex         index

2) Start your monograph by making a copy of the file chapter-template.tex
to <uniquename>.tex, using a distinct name (perhaps your last name) in place
of <uniquename>.  This will be your "driver file".  Fill in the top matter
(title, author(s), etc.) following the instructions that appear as comments
in the file.

Please note that the title page generated by this package is intended as
a placeholder, for information only.  The final title page will be created
at the AMS using the information provided on this placeholder page.

We recommend that chapters be prepared as separate files, using the sample
preface.tex and chap1.tex files as models; they are then called in using
\include{...} commands in your driver file.

3) More detailed instructions are given in the files instr-l.pdf and
handbk.pdf.  These manuals are also available via the web from
     ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/author-info/documentation/amslatex/instr-l.pdf
and  ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/author-info/documentation/handbk.pdf
respectively.  The handbook includes a checklist to be consulted, before
keyboarding your manuscript, in order to avoid the most common problems,
and detailed instructions for submitting your files to the AMS.

4) If your monograph will contain figures, print out, or view on screen,
the file creating-graphics.pdf and read it.  This file contains general
and specific guidelines for preparation of graphics (line art,
photographs, and other forms of illustrations) in a manner that will
ensure their accurate reproduction in print and on-line.

5) By default, the file chapter.tex listed above among the "sample document
files" uses the basic AMS monograph style, amsbook.cls.

Replace the \documentclass{amsbook} line in this file by
\documentclass{*-l}, where * is the specific series code, and then LaTeX
the file, in order to view the printed style for that particular series.
For example, if you are preparing a manuscript for the CRMM series,
BEFORE you LaTeX the file, replace amsbook with crmm-l (i.e.,
\documentclass{crmm-l}).

Do NOT use the sample chapter.tex file as a "starter" for your monograph.
Use the template file instead.  The sample files should be used only for
your reference.

amsbook.cls is included in this package because of the 2010 update to the
Mathematics Subject Classification.  This is the only change to amsbook
from the version in TeX Live distributions since 2005; the updated
version of amsbook.cls is included in TeX Live 2009, so if you are using
that distribution, you should delete the copy included in this package.

6) Various technical and administrative information can be found in the
AMS Author FAQ:
    http://www.ams.org/authors/author-faq.html
This document contains information on various topics that have been the
subject of questions to our Technical Support Group, as well as links
to other useful web pages, including the page with instructions for
submitting files when your monograph is ready.


Should you have any technical questions that aren't answered by the FAQ,
please contact our Technical Support Group.  The most effective method
is to send electronic mail to tech-support@ams.org, including a concise
statement of the problem, along with (if appropriate) a brief file that
illustrates the problem and the log of your attempt to LaTeX the file.
If e-mail is not an option, you can call 800-321-4AMS (800-321-4267,
in the U.S. or Canada) or 401-455-4080, or write to Technical Support,
Publications Technical Group, AMS, 201 Charles Street, Providence,
RI 02904-2294.
