\section*{Problem 1}

A subgroup $N$ of a group $G$ is called a {\it chracteristic subgroup} if $\phi(N)=N$
for all automorphisms $\phi$ of $G$.  Prove that every subgroup of a cyclic group is characteristic.

Let $\phi$ be an automorphism of $G$, a cyclic group.
Let $a$ be an element of $G$.  Now see that
\begin{equation*}
\phi(\langle a\rangle)=\{\phi(a^k)|k\in\Z\}=\{\phi^k(a)|k\in\Z\}=\langle\phi(a)\rangle.
\end{equation*}
Clearly, $|a|=|\phi(a)|$, so $|\langle a\rangle|=|\langle\phi(a)\rangle|$.  We can
now claim that $\langle a\rangle=\langle \phi(a)\rangle$ by the fundamental
theorem of cyclic groups, because $G$ has one and only one subgroup of each
possible order.

\section*{Problem 2}

Prove that the center of a group is characteristic.

Let $\phi$ be any automorphism of a group $G$.
Letting $a$ be an element in $\phi(Z(G))$ and $g$ an element in $G$,
there must exist an element $a'\in Z(G)$ and an element $g'\in G$ such
that $\phi(a')=a$ and $\phi(g')=g$.  It then follows that
\begin{equation*}
ag=\phi(a')\phi(g')=\phi(a'g')=\phi(g'a')=\phi(g')\phi(a')=ag,
\end{equation*}
showing that $a\in Z(G)$.
Thus far we have shown that $\phi(Z(G))\subseteq Z(G)$.
But $\phi$ is one-to-one, so $\phi(Z(G))$ cannot be a proper
subset of $Z(G)$, and therefore, we must have $\phi(Z(G))=Z(G)$.
Oops, what if $Z(G)$ is infinite?

I'm stumped...

\section*{Problem 4}

Prove that the property of being a characterstic subgroup is transitive.
That is, if $N$ is a characteristic subgroup of $K$ and $K$ is a characteristic
subgroup of $G$, then $N$ is a characteristic subgroup of $G$.

Let $\phi\in\aut(G)$.  If $\phi(K)=K$, then $\phi$, when restricted in
domain to $K$, is an automorphism of $K$.  It follows that
$\phi(N)=N$, showing that $N$ is a characteristic subgroup of $G$.

\section*{Problem 6}

Let $H$ and $K$ be subgroups of a group $G$ and let $HK=\{hk|h\in H,k\in K\}$
and $KH=\{kh|k\in K,h\in H\}$.  Prove that $HK$ is a group if and only if
$HK=KH$.

Suppose $HK=KH$.  Clearly $e\in HK$.  Let $a,b\in HK$.
Then there exists $h,h'\in H$ and $k,k'\in K$ such that
$a=hk$ and $b=h'k'$, and we have
\begin{equation*}
ab^{-1}=hk(h'k')^{-1}=hk(k')^{-1}(h')^{-1} = hh''k''\in HK,
\end{equation*}
for some element $h''\in H$ and another $k''\in K$, because
$HK=KH$.

Now suppose $HK$ is a subgroup of $G$.  If $a\in HK$,
then $a^{-1}=hk$ for some $h\in H$ and $k\in K$.
It follows that $a=k^{-1}h^{-1}\in KH$.
If $a\in KH$, then $a=hk$ for some $h\in H$ and $k\in K$.
It follows that $a^{-1}=h^{-1}k^{-1}\in HK\implies (a^{-1})^{-1}=a\in HK$.

\section*{Problem 7}

Let $H$ and $K$ be subgroups of a finite group $G$.  Prove that
\begin{equation*}
|HK|=\frac{|H||K|}{|H\cap K|}.
\end{equation*}
This is easy to prove when $H\cap K=\{e\}$.  Think about it.
