The Moral Force of Women -- Elder D. Todd Christofferson
========================================================

To generate the best discussion and understanding, the right questions have to be asked.  If I fail to ask the right questions about some of Elder Christofferson's talk, please speak up.

Read P1.

Ask: What is this "innate moral power" within women and why does society rely upon it?

Read P2.

Ask: Can anyone here attest to the moral influence that their Mother has had on them and explain how it has helped you become a better person?

Thought: It's probably no accident that Mothers are stereotyped as being the parent who instils all sorts of morals and virtues in their children, such as, "Didn't your Mom teach you that it's no polite to pick your nose in public?", and "Didn't your Mom teach you to play nice with others?", and so on.  Mothers seem to shape their children in ways that Fathers don't or are not prone to.

Ask: How powerful is the moral influence of women?

Read P8-9.

Ask: Is it possible that we have sometimes taken for granted the moral influence of women?  If so, how?

Thought: It's probably very easy to take for granted the positive moral influences of women, and the importance of such influences, when our society is bombarded with negative moral influences of women.

Read P11-12.

Ask: Since most women are stay-at-home mothers, how do we keep a proper balance of parental responsibilities?

Read footnote 8.

Ask: One of the major sacrifices that Mothers make is usually that of a career so that she can focus on raising the children.  What sacrifices can and should we make for the same purpose?

Thought: As a child, home is somehow not as much a place of contentment unless Mother is around.

Read P13-14.

Ask: Does anyone have any thoughts about this?

Read P15-16.

Ask: How can we help our daughters cultivate the innate moral power within them?

Read P17-19.

Ask: How do we, as priesthood brethren, cultivate our own moral authority and exercise that authority for the benefit of our families?

Thought: There are some topics about morality that are best had privately between a Father and his son.  This is one instance where the Father's moral authority is put into action.
