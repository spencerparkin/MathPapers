	  Hi.  I'm Spencer.  <a href="http://www.weber.edu/mathematics">Weber State University</a> made the mistake of awarding me a bachelor of science degree in Mathematics.  I work for Disney Interactive writing software.  I enjoy hiking, trail jogging, rock climbing, spending time with my family in the outdoors, and, in my spare time, writing really crappy math papers.  Now I don't want them to be crappy, of course, but I must admit that a few of them are of low enough quality that it doesn't speak well to the journals that accepted them.  Nevertheless, my interests have driven me to investigate a few topics in math, and writing about them is a way of formalizing and sharing the ideas.  Unfortunately, no one really takes an interest in the same questions that I struggle to answer.  It's probably because I'm asking stupid questions, or not answering them very well, or both.  In any case, you can find here the crap that I've written.  Enjoy.
