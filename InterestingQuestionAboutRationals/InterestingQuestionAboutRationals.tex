\title{An Interesting Question About\\The Rationals $\Q$}

\section*{Axiom}

For any $q\in\Q$, let $Z(q)$ denote the set $\{zq|z\in\Z\}$.
Then for any proper subgroup $H$ of the rationals $\Q$ under addition,
there exists $q\in \Q-H$ such that $Z(q)\cap H$ is the trivial
subgroup of $\Q$.

\section*{The Problem}

Show that no proper subgroup $H$ of $\Q$ is maximal.

If $q\in\Q-H$, it is easy to show that $H+Z(q)$
properly contains $H$ and is a subgroup of $\Q$.
Let $q\in\Q-H$ be an element of $\Q$ such that $Z(q)\cap H$
is the trivial group.  This can be done by the axiom above.

What remains to be shown is that $H+Z(q)$ is a proper
subgroup of $\Q$.  Suppose $\Q=H+Z(q)$.
Notice that $q/2\not\in H$, (since this would imply that $q\in H$), and $q/2\not\in Z(q)$.
Yet we must have $q/2=zq+h$ for some $h\in H$ and $z\in\Z$.
Rearranging, we have $2h=(1-2z)q$.  Now since $2h\in H$
and $(1-2z)q\in Z(q)$, we must have $2h=(1-2z)q\in Z(q)\cap H$ which
implies that $h=0$ and $q=0$.  But this contradicts the facts that
$q\not\in H$ and $q/2\not\in Z(q)$.  So $H+Z(q)$ is a proper subgroup of $\Q$.
