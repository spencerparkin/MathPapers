\chapter{Foundations Of Geometric Algebra}

\section{Introduction}

This chapter presents the general results of
geometric algebra (GA) that we will find useful in the
coming treatment of the conformal model.  It is assumed
that the reader is already familiar with GA, and so
we do not develop the language of GA here from the
ground up.  If the reader is already well versed in GA,
they may consider skipping this chapter.
