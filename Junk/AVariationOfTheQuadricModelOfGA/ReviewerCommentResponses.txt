COMMENTS FOR THE AUTHOR:

Reviewer #1: This paper is pretty well written and seems correct.  It doesn't extend things very far though.  The main results seem new.  It does give an interesting approach to the problem.  There should be a few changes listed below. If the paper that it depends on is published then I am recommending this be published (but it will be the editor's choice).

*** The dependent paper, AACA-12-00082R1, has been accepted.

Figure 1 (the graphics picture) should precede the references.  It is good that the computer code is given as an example of the quartic, but it is not clear what language or software is being used, and this should be stated.

*** The placement of the figure has been fixed.  The language and software have now been stated.

Reviewer #2: This paper extends a previous definition of the model for quadric surfaces using geometric algebra proposed by the same author. According to the author, the main property of the new model is being equipped with versors encoding rigid body motions that can be applied to any blade representing a quadric surface. However, the presented results are not clear due to lack of precision of some equations and statements. In such a case, I believe that the paper should be reconsidered after major revision.

*** The original submission was poorly named.  The model given is not an extension of the original model.  It is a variation of the original model, and I do not rely on any definitions given in the paper that sets forth the original model.  This paper is therefore self contained as I'm sure you'll be able to see.  Furthermore, a careful look at equation (3.2) will convince you that 2-vectors, not generally blades, are claimed to be the representatives of quadric surfaces in the model.  I agree that my original submission lacked a great deal of precision.  I have therefore done my best to be more precise and to address the concerns of the reviewers.

The text is well written, but it is not self-contained. Notice that the previous works is not available for download yet. Therefore, it is quite difficult (or even impossible) to assert some definitions presented in the current manuscript. The author must include more details about his previous model in order to make this paper self-contained.

*** I again maintain that the paper is self-contained and that it does not rely on any definitions given in the prior paper.  A more careful reading will assert this.  I may loosely refer to one or two definitions in the prior paper, but I do not rely upon them to develop the model in the present paper.

The tilde operation used in Equation (2.4) was not defined. It denotes a reverse operation?

*** The tilde operation has been removed; however, it is often used as the reverse operation, and this should have been clear in context.  In any case, it doesn't matter anymore as it has been removed in favor of a more compact formulation of the element S.

Assuming that the tilde in Equation (2.4) denotes the reverse operation, the property presented in the first line of page 3 is incorrect because it seems that S is not a unary even versor (i.e., a rotor).

*** The statement you are pointing at was indeed incorrect, and I have corrected the mistake in the newly submitted paper.  You have also pointed out here a gross oversight on my part.  I had never questioned whether S was a versor.  It appears that it is NOT a versor.  I therefore do not refer to it as a versor in the paper.  Interestingly, when it is used as one usually uses versors, it performs a rotation-like effect.  I, however, do not refer to it geometrically as a rotation, but rely simply on the algebraic properties of the construction.

The element E has a different interpretation in Equation (2.4) and in Equation (3.1). The author should use a different notation.

*** The variable E is re-used to mean different things in different contexts.  E is just the name of a variable.  Every time E is used, it is being made very clear how we're intending to use it and how we're interpreting it.  In equation (2.4), we're interpreting E as any element of G(V).  In equation (3.1) we are interpreting it as any element in G(W).

The operation precedence in Equations (3.1), (4.1)-(4.5), (4.16), (4.17), (4.19)-(4.23), (5.1), (5.3) is not clear. The author must use parentheses in order to ensure the order of operations.

*** It has been made clear in a newly added footnote that the outer product takes precedence over the inner product, and that the geometric product takes precedence over the inner and outer products.  This removes the need for parentheses that would otherwise clutter the math, making it even more obscure.

The author does not define the dot symbol for cases different than the inner product of vectors. It is clear that it is an inner product. However, for general blades the inner product could be a scalar product, a left contraction or a right contraction, among others.

*** I have added extensive clarification on the type of inner product the paper uses.

From Equation (3.1), it makes sense to state that E is the dual of a quadric surface since the expected (or intuitive) behavior in any model of geometry would be p ^ X = 0, where X is blade geometrically interpreted as some geometric entity and p is a vector spanning X and interpreted as a point. In such a case, we would have dual(p ^ X) = dual(0) leading to p . dual(X) = 0. In the proposed model p would be replaced by the 2-blade p ^ overbar{p}, and \dual(X) by E.

*** I think I understand what you're saying.  The notion of dual and direct geometries is born out of a model that uses blades to represent its geometries (surfaces).  But we are not using blades to represent quadric surfaces here.  We are using 2-vectors.  The idea of using blades (not 2-vectors) to represent quadric surfaces is address later on in the paper with a new section that I've added, which also brings up the notion of dual and direct geometries.

In Equation (3.2), the author presents how the general form of a quadric is represented as a 2-vector. From such definition [a] it is not possible do guarantee that the 2-vector is also a 2-blade as one would expect while defining a model of geometry. The author should make a comment about that.

*** Again, no effort, expressed or implied, was made to use 2-blades as representatives of geometric surfaces.  For example, I do not assume that E in (3.2) is a 2-blade, nor do I rely on E in (3.2) as being a 2-blade for any of the results to go through.  Indeed, and as you pointed out, E in (3.2) is not always a 2-blade.  More than a comment about this will be made in the newly added section which will address the representation of quadric surfaces (or surfaces of any degree or form) using blades of any grade.

Assuming that Equation (3.2) defines a blade, would [it] be possible to build a quadric surface as the outer product of vectors interpreted as points?

*** This question is addressed in the newly added section, even if it is not fully answered.  Consider the newly revised paper's definition of a "point-fit-able" blade.

The sentence "For example, many common quadrics are the solution set in..." must be rephrased. The author should be more specific about which quadratic surface he is talking about.

*** This phrase has been refined.

It is not clear why -p ^ overbar{p} was factored out from Equation (3.5) in order to define Equation (3.6).

*** The text "E =" was inserted into equation (3.6), which I hope will make it clearer.  This element E, by definition 3.1, is then representative of the same surface that is the solution set in x of equation (3.5).

It seems that an overbar is missing from b and d in Equations (4.3) and (4.4) because the use of Equation (2.4) to convert overbar{b} and overbar{d} into, respectively, b and d would lead to a different result.

*** There are no over-bars missing in equations (4.3) and (4.4).  You have to look at it more carefully.  Notice that for any two vectors a and b, we have a.b = bar(a).bar(b).  That is, the inner product between two vectors in V gives the same result as the inner product of two vectors in bar(V).  V and bar(V) are identical vector spaces.

The following algebraic manipulations must be clarified: Equation (4.3) to (4.4), and (4.4) to (4.5), and (4.14) to (4.15), and (4.21) to (4.22).

*** It is well known that a.b = VaV^{-1}.VbV^{-1}.  Apply this identity to get from step (4.3) to (4.4).  You did not request a clarification of the step from (4.2) to (4.3).  The same algebraic manipulations to get from (4.2) to (4.3) are used to get from (4.5) to (4.4).  The step from (4.14) to (4.15) is trivial.  It is A^{-1}B^{-1}=(BA)^{-1}.  Equation (4.15), however, did have an algebraic mistake in it, which I have corrected.  You also have to realize that the over-bar can be broken up as desired if we are using the geometric product.  For example, bar(A)bar(B)=bar(AB), though both the left and right sides of this equation would be type-set the same in Latex.  (Adjacent bars touch one another.)  The step from (4.21) to (4.22) is already clarified by the statement, "The first equality holds by the fact that E is of the form (3.2)."  For this to make sense to the reader, they must understand what kind of inner product we are using.  Having corrected the oversite of omitting a description of the inner product we are using, perhaps it will be more clearn now.  Note that I do expect the reader to prove some steps for themselves, which may take some effort on paper.  I do not expect the reader to make any leap that isn't difficult to figure out on paper, if they are willing to do it.  In any case, you'll find that I have done much in the revised paper to make these steps clearer.

It seems that an overbar is missing in Equations (4.19) and (4.20).

*** Yes.  This was a mistake that has now been corrected.

In order to be more specific, in Equation (4.24), pi in V^{infinity}

*** While it is true that pi is in V^{infinity}, I chose V so that it is more clear that we are about to apply Theorem 4.2.  Theorem 4.2 uses versors taken from V.  If pi is taken from V^{infinity}, then it is also taken from V, since V^{infinity} is a sub-space of V.

A citation of the literature should be included before Equation (2.24).

*** A citation has been added.

According to Equation (4.25), the application of the “versor” pi into p turn the vector p into a general multivector (notice the presence of the scalar component -2 ((x - c) . n)). Therefore, pi is an ill formed versor because it does not have the expected structure preservation property.

*** There was a terrible algebraic mistake made in equation (4.25) that has now been corrected.  I hope that you will now find that it all makes sense.

The term x used in Equation (4.25) was not defined.

*** I have corrected this oversite.

Assuming that Equation (4.25) was corrected, the reflection on a hyperplane is not sufficient to build all Euclidean transformations. Isotropic scaling and transversion would require the reflection on hyperspheres. The author must include the derivation of this kind of reflection.

*** No claim in the paper was made that we have developed the entire set of Euclidean transformations.  The claim made in the paper, (as you'll clearly be able to see on a second reading), was that we have found all rigid-body motions.  The derivation of the entire set of conformal transformations is done later on in the paper.

The last paragraph of Section 4 must be rephrased. The author should be more specific.

*** That paragraph has been removed.  It was not needed.

The statements presented in Section 5 must be proved by derivations. Otherwise they are conjectures that should be removed from the manuscript or presented as directions for future exploration.

*** I have revisited this section and rigorized it extensively.
