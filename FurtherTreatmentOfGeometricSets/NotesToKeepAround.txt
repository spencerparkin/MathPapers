\section{Perliminary Material}

Recall that the reverse of any geometric product is simply a geometric product
taken with the reverse of the same arguments, but in reverse order.  In mathematical
terms, for any $X,Y\in\G$, we have $(XY)^{\reverse{}}=\reverse{Y}\reverse{X}$.
This leaves us wondering what to make of the reverse of $X$ and $Y$.
If $X,Y\in\V$, then $\reverse{X}=X$ and $\reverse{Y}=Y$, and we
have $(XY)^{\reverse{}}=YX$.  Interestingly, if any one (or both) of $X$ and $Y$ is
not a vector, we can still boil $(XY)^{\reverse{}}$ down to an element of $\G$.
This is done by letting the reverse be a linear operator, then by realizing that
every sum of blades (every multivector) can be rewritten as a sum of geometric
products, where each product is that of one or more vectors.\footnote{Since
each vector may or may not be invertible, we can't say that any multivector can
be rewritten as a sum of versors.}  Indeed, one way to realize the geometric
product of any two multivectors is two first write each of them as a sum of geometric
products, distribute, then rewrite the resulting sum of geometric products as a sum of blades.
\begin{lem}
For any $s$-blade $B\in\B$ with factorization $B=\bigwedge_{i=1}^s b_i$, we have
\begin{equation}
\reverse{B} = \bigwedge_{i=1}^s b_{1+s-i}.
\end{equation}
\begin{proof}
A proof by induction is given.  The case $s=1$ is trivial.  The case $s=2$ is also trivial.
\begin{align}
(b_1\wedge b_2)^{\reverse{}} &= (b_1b_2)^{\reverse{}} - b_1\cdot b_2\nonumber \\
 &= b_2b_1 - b_2\cdot b_1\nonumber \\
 &= b_2\wedge b_1
\end{align}
Now for some fixed integer $s>2$, we assume that our lemma holds for the
cases $s-1$ and $s-2$.  Doing so, we see that
\begin{align}
\reverse{B} &= (b_1B_1)^{\reverse{}} - (b_1\cdot B_1)^{\reverse{}} \\
 &= \reverse{B_1}b_1 - \reverse{B_1}\cdot b_1 \\
\end{align}
\end{proof}
