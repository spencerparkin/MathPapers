\section*{Exercise 1}

Let $H=\{(1),(12)\}$.  Is $H$ normal in $S_3$.

No, $(123)H\neq H(123)$, because $(123)(12)=(13)\neq(23)=(12)(123)$.

\section*{Exercise 2}

Prove that $A_n$ is normal in $S_n$.

Let $\alpha\in A_n$ and let $\beta\in S_n$.  Now notice that $\beta\alpha\beta^{-1}\in A_n$,
in the case that $\beta$ is an even permutation, or an odd permuation.
It then follows by Theorem 9.1 that $A_n$ is a normal subgroup of $S_n$.

\section*{Exercise 3}

Show that if $G$ is the internal direct product of $H_1,H_2,\dots,H_n$ and
$i\neq j$ with $1\leq i\leq n$, $1\leq j\leq n$, then $H_i\cap H_j=\{e\}$.

Without loss of generality, let $i<j$.
Now notice that
\begin{equation*}
H_i\subseteq H_1H_2\dots H_i\dots H_{j-2}H_{j-1}
\end{equation*}
and that $H_1H_2\dots H_i\dots H_{j-2}H_{j-1}\cap H_j=\{e\}$.
It follows that $H_i\cap H_j=\{e\}$.

\section*{Finishing Theorem 9.6}

We are given $\phi(h_1h_2\dots h_n)=(h_1,h_2,\dots,h_n)$.
It is immediately clear that $\phi$ is onto $H_1\oplus H_2\oplus\dots\oplus H_n$.
By the uniqueness of representation of elements in $H_1H_2\dots H_n$ already proven,
it follows that $\phi$ is one-to-one.  That $\phi$ is operation preserving follows
from the commutativity among disjoint subgroups.  For all integers $i\in[1,n]$,
for all $a_i,b_i\in H_i$, we have
\begin{align*}
 & \phi(a_1a_2\dots a_nb_1b_2\dots b_n) \\
 =\,&\phi(a_1b_1a_2b_2\dots a_nb_n) \\
 =\,&(a_1b_1,a_2b_2,\dots,a_nb_n) \\
 =\,&(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n)(b_1,b_2,\dots,b_n) \\
 =\,&\phi(a_1a_2\dots a_n)\phi(b_1b_2\dots b_n).
\end{align*}

\section*{Exercise 7}

Prove that if $H$ has index 2 in $G$, then $H$ is normal in $G$.

The cosets of $H$ in $G$ are $H$ and $xH$ for any $x\in G-H$.
Now consider $Hx$.  This is $H$ or $xH$.  But it can't be $H$, because $x\not\in H$.
It must, therefore, be $xH$.

\section*{Exercise 10}

Prove that a factor group of a cyclic group is cyclic.

Let $H$ be a normal subgroup of a cyclic group $G=\langle g\rangle$.
(All cyclic groups are Abelian and therefore, all subgroups of a cyclic
group are normal.)  We then see that
\begin{equation*}
G/H = \{aH|a\in G\}=\{g^kH|k\in\Z\}=\langle gH\rangle.
\end{equation*}

\section*{Exercise 11}

Let $H$ be a normal subgroup of $G$.  If $H$ and $G/H$ are Abelian, must $G$
be Abelian?

No.  Consider $G=D_4$ and $H$ as the subgroup of rotations in $D_4$.

\section*{Exercise 12}

Prove that a factor group of a cyclic group is cyclic.

Let $a,b\in G/H$ with $a=xH$ and $b=yH$ for $x,y\in G$.
We then have
\begin{equation*}
ab=xHyH=xyH=yxH=yHxH=ba.
\end{equation*}

\section*{Exercise 44}

If $|G|=pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are primes that are not necessarily distinct,
prove that $|Z(G)|=1$ or $pq$.

If $Z(G)=\{e\}$, we're done.  So suppose $Z(G)\neq\{e\}$.
Notice that $G$ must have an element of order $q$, since
if $a\in G$ and $a\neq e$, we have $(a^p)^q=e\implies |a^p|=q$
by Legrange's Theorem and by Corollary 2 of Theorem 4.1.
Similarly, $G$ must have an element of order $p$.

Suppose $p\neq q$.  Let $a,b\in G$ be elements of orders $p$ and $q$, respectively.
Then $\langle a\rangle$ is a normal subgroup
in $G$, since for all $g\in G-\langle a\rangle$, and any integer $k$, the element
$ga^kg^{-1}$ has the same order as $a^k$, so we have
$g\langle a\rangle g^{-1}\subseteq \langle a\rangle$.
Similarly, $\langle b\rangle$ is normal in $G$.
Furthermore, it is clear that $\langle a\rangle\cap\langle b\rangle=\{e\}$.
Now if $x,x'\in\langle a\rangle$ and $y,y'\in\langle b\rangle$, and
if $xy=x'y'$, then $(x')^{-1}x=y'y^{-1}\in\langle a\rangle\cap\langle b\rangle$,
so $x=x'$ and $y=y'$, and we see that $\langle a\rangle\langle b\rangle=G$.
We can now invoke Theorem 9.6, and say that
\begin{equation*}
G\approx\langle a\rangle\oplus\langle b\rangle\approx Z_p\oplus Z_q,
\end{equation*}
and it follows that $Z(G)=G$ and therefore $|Z(G)|=pq$.

Now suppose $p=q$.  If there exists an element $g\in G$
with order $pq$, we're done, since $G\approx Z_{p^2}\implies Z(G)=G$.
So suppose that $G$ has no such element.  Go on...

\section*{Exercise 46}

Let $G$ be an Abelian group and let $H$ be the subgroup consisting
of all elements of $G$ that have finite order.  Prove that every nonidentity
element in $G/H$ has infinite order.

Let $a\in G/H$ be a non-identity element.  Then there exists $g\in G$ such
that $a=gH$.  Clearly $g\not\in H$ by Property 2 of the Lemma for Theorem 7.1.
It follows that $|g|=\infty$.

\section*{Exercise 61}

Suppose that $H$ is a normal subgroup of a finite group $G$.
If $G/H$ has an element of order $n$, show that $H$ has an element of order $n$.
Show, by example, that the assumption that $G$ is finite is necessary.

The case $n=1$ is trivial, so let $n>1$.  Let $a\in G$ such that $|aH|=n$.  Clearly $a\neq e$.
It follows that the mapping $\phi:H\to H$, given by $\phi(h)=a^nh$ is a non-trivial permutation of
the elements of $H$ and so $\phi$ is a member of the group of permutations of $H$.
We then see that $a^{|\phi|n}=e$.  But it is easy to see that for all
integers $i\in [1,|\phi|n-1]$, we have $a^i\neq e$.  So $|a^{|\phi|}|=n$.

\section*{Exercise 62}

Do it...

\section*{Exercise 65}

If $|G|=30$ and $|Z(G)|=5$, what is the
structure of $G/Z(G)?$.

Note that $|G/Z(G)|=30/5=6=2\cdot 3$.
It follows from Theorem 7.2 that $G/Z(G)$
is isomorphic to $Z_6$ or $D_3$.  Erf...which one?
Think about it.
