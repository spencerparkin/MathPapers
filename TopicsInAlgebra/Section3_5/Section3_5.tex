\section*{Thoughts}

Let $R$ be a commutative ring and let $a\in R$.  Is there such a thing as ``the ideal $I$ generated by $a$?''
I suppose this would be the smallest possible ideal $I$ of $R$ containing $a$.
Consider
\begin{equation*}
I = \{ra|r\in R\}.
\end{equation*}
It is not hard to show that this is an ideal of $R$.  Is it the smallest?  Or could there be other ideals
of $R$ of the same size and containing $a$?

\section*{Problem 4}

Let $R$ be the ring of all real-valued continuous functions on the closed unit interval.
If $M$ is a maximal ideal of $R$, prove that there exists a real number $\gamma$,
$0\leq\gamma\leq 1$, such that $M=M_{\gamma}=\{f(x)\in R|f(\gamma)=0\}$.

Let $f\in R$ be a non-zero-valued continuous function on $[0,1]$, and suppose $I$, an ideal of $R$,
contains it.  Now let $g\in R$ be any member of $R$.  Does there exist a function $h\in R$ such that
$fh=g$?  Clearly there must, since $f$, being non-zero on $[0,1]$, allows us to write $h=g/f$.
We can now conclude that $I=R$, and that for every properly contained ideal $I$ of $R$, if $f\in I$,
then there exists $\gamma\in[0,1]$ such that $f(\gamma)=0$.
Now if $I$ is a maximal ideal of $R$, it is properly contained in $R$, so such an $f$ exists in $I$.
We could further argue that such an $f$ exists in $I$ that has {\it exactly one} zero at $\gamma$.
(Make argument here.)
Now if $I$ contains such an $f$, what other functions must it contain?
Let $g\in R$ be any function that is zero at $\gamma$.  (It may or may not be zero else-where.)
Does there exist $h\in R$ such that $fh=g$?  If we write
\begin{equation*}
h(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}f(x)/g(x) & x\neq\gamma\\ 0 & x=\gamma \end{array}\right.,
\end{equation*}
then can we argue that $h$ is a continuous function on $[0,1]$?  Unfortunately, no.
There is no guarentee that $\lim_{x\to 0} h(x)=0$.

If we could find such an $h$, then we know we have found $I=M_{\gamma}$, because
$I$ is properly contained in $R$ and $M_{\gamma}$ is maximal in $R$ by Example 3.5.2.
