The First and Great Commandment
Elder Jeffery R. Holland

Recommend everyone going online and reading this talk.

Elder Holland's talk tells the story of the disciples second call to discipleship.  How is this story relevant to us?  Though none of us here is an Apostle, I believe that we can all consider ourselves disciples of Jesus Christ.

-- When were we called to be disciples of Jesus Christ?

-- What does it mean to be a disciple of Jesus Christ?

-- After being called as a disciple of Jesus Christ, how many of us have gone on to have further spiritual and testimony-building experiences?  How have these experiences affected or influenced your discipleship?

As Elder Holland points out, the disciples whom Jesus loved walked with him, talked with him, and experienced all of His miracles, yet after the Atonmentment and Resurrection, they needed to be called to discipleship a second time.

-- Why?  Why did they need a second call to discipleship?

Elder Holland recounts the conversation with Peter where he is to answer three times in the affirmative to the question posed by the Savior, "Lovest thou Me more than this?"

-- In the story, "this" referred to the apostle's original vocation.  What does "this" refer to for us?

Some points to make:
 * Admit to letting personal endeavors get in the way of church responsibilities.  Give examples.  If there is anything like this in our lives, we need to reprioritize so that the Lord comes first.
 * Admit that if I were being a true disciple, all the things that may seem hard to do in the church, (such as getting home-teaching done every month, getting to church every week, regularly attending the temple, performing service when it comes up, not slacking back on my church calling, etc.), would actually be very easy, and not feel burdensome at all.
 * Cite Ammon as an example of loyalty.  Though often used as an example of missionary work, his example, I believe, shows us how a true disciple would serve the Lord.  Alma 18:10 -- That's how we need to be with the Lord's commandments.
 * All of this leads to a very interesting bit of symbolism brought out by Elder Holland in his talk.

 But, alas, the fishing wasn’t very good. Their first night back on the lake, they caught nothing—not a single fish. With the first rays of dawn, they disappointedly turned toward the shore, where they saw in the distance a figure who called out to them, “Children, have you caught anything?” Glumly these Apostles-turned-again-fishermen gave the answer no fisherman wants to give. “We have caught nothing,” they muttered, and to add insult to injury, they were being called “children.”4

“Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find,”5 the stranger calls out—and with those simple words, recognition begins to flood over them. Just three years earlier these very men had been fishing on this very sea. On that occasion too they had “toiled all the night, and [had] taken nothing,”6 the scripture says. But a fellow Galilean on the shore had called out to them to let down their nets, and they drew “a great multitude of fishes,”7 enough that their nets broke, the catch filling two boats so heavily they had begun to sink.

Now it was happening again. These “children,” as they were rightly called, eagerly lowered their net, and “they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.”8 John said the obvious: “It is the Lord.”9 And over the edge of the boat, the irrepressible Peter leaped.

-- What is symbolized by the futile fishing of the apostles?

Some points to make:
 * The futile fishing symbolizes us trying to do our own thing instead of doing what the Lord would have us do.
 * The _only_ work that matters in this life and that has eternal rewards is the Lord's work.  All other accomplishments in this world are frustrated and/or have an end!  We must align our will with His.
 * The Lord can do more with our lives than we could do with them.
 * Holland says, "To those who were once with us but have retreated, preferring to pick and choose a few cultural hors d’oeuvres from the smorgasbord of the Restoration and leave the rest of the feast, I say that I fear you face a lot of long nights and empty nets."
 * If there is anything in our lives that we're prioritizing above our participation in the Lord's Kingdom here upon the earth, then we are like fisherman in a lake with no fish!  I might work all my days and accomplish a great task, but in the end, because it doesn't build the Lord's Kingdom, it profits me nothing.
 
"hors d’oeuvres" -- Little apatizers before the main meal.

-- Why is it that when a disciple is called, he is called for life?  Why is there no going back after being called to discipleship?  (What would it mean to go back?  Yeah, that's bad.)

Elder Holland said, "So we have neighbors to bless, children to protect, the poor to lift up, and the truth to defend.  We have wrongs to make right, truths to share, and good to do.  In short, we have a life of devoted discipleship to give in demonstrating our love of the Lord.  We can't quit and we can't go back.  After an encounter with the living Son of the living God, nothing is ever again to be as it was before.  The Crucifiction, Atonement, and Resurrection of Jesus Christ mark the beginning of a Christian life, not the end of it."

Becoming less devoted, not more devoted, at any time after a testimony building experience, (one in which the Spirit was felt and recognized), is a very bad thing.

Part of the test of this life, I believe, is that of our loyalty after recieving a witness from the Holy Ghost.  After the Spirit testifies of a truth to your soul, there becomes a permanent new reality for you to live up to.  Once you gain a testimony of, for example, tithing, you can't fail to pay your tithing.

All of this so far gives us a new perspective on the first and great commandment.

-- From our new-found perspective of discipleship, as we have discussed it, what does it mean to keep the first and great commandment?

Holland says, "My beloved brothers and sisters, I am not certain just what our experience will be on Judgment Day, but I will be very surprised if at some point in that conversation, God does not ask us exactly what Christ asked Peter: “Did you love me?” I think He will want to know if in our very mortal, very inadequate, and sometimes childish grasp of things, did we at least understand one commandment, the first and greatest commandment of them all—“Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind.”13 And if at such a moment we can stammer out, “Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee,” then He may remind us that the crowning characteristic of love is always loyalty."
