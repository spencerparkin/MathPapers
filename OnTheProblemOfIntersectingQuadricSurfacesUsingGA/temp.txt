Fortunately, what may be an alternative to our original plan is that of using
$C\wedge e_3$ and $E\wedge e_3$ to generate a system of non-linear
equations.  The idea is simple.  If we know that we have a point $x\in\gd(E\wedge e_3)$, (our
canonical form), then we also have $x\in\gd(C\wedge e_3)$, (our desired intersection), and this generates
for us one or more equations in the components $x_i$ of $x$.  For example,
if we let $x=(h+a)e_1 + ke_2$, then $p(x)\cdot E\wedge e_3$ is clearly
zero, and therefore, $p(x)\cdot C\wedge e_3=(p(x)\cdot C)e_3$ must be zero too.\footnote{This
idea calls into question the use of geometric algebra as a framework for solving
the problem at hand.  Could we not just as easily take this approach using nothing
more than our original polynomial equations \eqref{equ_ellipse} and \eqref{equ_conical_surface}?
Yes; however, the use of some framework, whether it be geometric, linear or abstract algebra,
may help us make useful generalizations about the problem as the lemmas of this
paper attempt to do.}

A lemma is now in order.  For the following lemma, the asterisk symbol ``$*$'' may be
replaced, if done in a consistent manner, by either the inner product symbol ``$\cdot$'' or
the outer product symbol ``$\wedge$.''

\begin{lem}\label{lma_determine_system}
Given a blade $B\in\G$, if $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^j\subseteq g^*(B)$ is a
set of $j$ points with $\bigwedge_{i=1}^{j-1} p(x_i)\neq 0$ and $\bigwedge_{i=1}^j p(x_i)=0$,
then the system of equations generated by, for all integers $i\in[1,j]$, $0=p(x_i)* B$,
is not any more determined than the system of equations generated by,
for all integers $i\in[1,j-1]$, $0=p(x_i)* B$.\footnote{This is
also to say that the system of equations generated by all $j$ points has the same solution
set as that generated by all $j-1$ points.}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
For an appropriate set of $j-1$ scalars $\{\lambda_i\}_{i=1}^{j-1}\subset\R$, letting $p(x_j)=\sum_{i=1}^{j-1}\lambda_i p(x_i)$,
the equation $0=p(x_j)* B$ contributes to the system all equations generated by
\begin{equation*}
0 = \sum_{i=1}^{j-1}\lambda_ip(x_i)* B,
\end{equation*}
which is not any new information.  (Generating new equations by adding scalar multiples of existing equations
together does not make a system of equations any more determined.)
\end{proof}
What Lemma~\ref{lma_determine_system} is telling us is that if we want any hope of generating a sufficiently determined
system, then we must only consider sets of points $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^j\subset\gd(E\wedge e_3)$
for which $\bigwedge_{i=1}^j p(x_i)\neq 0$.  Realizing this, it is worth taking a moment to
consider the circumstances under which such a set of $j$ points produces a linearly
independent set of vectors $\{p(x_i)\}_{i=1}^j$.

Doing so, it is immediately clear that if $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^j$ is a linearly independent
set of points in $\R^n$, then so is the set $\{p(x_i)\}_{i=1}^j$, but we can do
a little better than this with the following lemma.




At this point we would wish to return to our example, but
lemmas ~\ref{lma_determine_system} and ~\ref{lma_non_co_planar} do
not allow us to do so.  Lemma~\ref{lma_determine_system} offers a
necessary, but insufficient condition for obtaining a completely determined system,
and Lemma~\ref{lma_non_co_planar} is not even enough to help us satisfy this condition.
