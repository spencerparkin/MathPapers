\section*{The Application Of Euler Angles}

Let $R_x$, $R_y$ and $R_z$ each be unit-rotors that rotate about the $x$, $y$ and $z$ axes, respectively.
Then it is easy to imagine the rotation generated by the rotor $R_zR_yR_x$.
A point is rotated about the $x$-axis, then the $y$, and then the $z$.  With each rotation is about
a fixed axis.  We can similarly deduce the affect of the rotation generated by the
rotor $R_xR_yR_z$.  However, we are free to think of the rotation generated by
$R_xR_yR_z$ in the order of first rotating about the $x$-axis, then a (not the) $y$-axis, and then
a (not the) $z$-axis, if, to be more specific, we think about such a $y$-axis as a rotation of the $y$-axis.
Similarly, we must think of about such a $z$-axis as a rotation of the $z$-axis.  This can all be explained
algebraiclyas follows.  Consider a vector $v$ to be rotated by $R_xR_yR_z$.  Instead of applying $R_z$
first, which is what we would naturally want to do to get the rotation $v'$ of $v$ as
\begin{equation}\label{equ_zyx}
v' = R_xR_yR_z v \tilde{R}_z\tilde{R}_y\tilde{R}_x,
\end{equation}
we will apply $R_x$ first, and write
\begin{equation}\label{equ_euler_xyz}
v' = R(R_x R_y \tilde{R}_x)R_x v \tilde{R}_x(R_x \tilde{R}_y \tilde{R}_x)\tilde{R},
\end{equation}
where the rotor $R$ is given by
\begin{equation*}
R = ((R_xR_y\tilde{R}_x)R_x)R_z((R_xR_y\tilde{R}_x)R_x)^{-1}.
\end{equation*}
Here we must realize that we can apply rotors to rotors to rotate the axis of rotation
about which a rotor rotates.  (Pardon the tongue twister.)  The pattern here is seen as an application of $R_x$ first,
then the application of $R_y$ with what was first applied to $v$, (namely $R_y$), applied to it,
then the application of $R_z$ with what was then applied to $v$, (namely $R$), applied to it.

Visualizing the rotation of the vector $v$ in equation \eqref{equ_euler_xyz}, we see that
with each rotation, we must also apply that rotation to the $xyz$-axis frame about which we do subsequent rotations.
Indeed, this is how Euler rotations are applied.  Interestingly, what we find is that when we
simplify equation \eqref{equ_euler_xyz}, we arrive at equation \eqref{equ_zyx}.
It follows now that the application of the Euler angles first in the $x$, then $y$, then $z$-axis,
is accomplished by a rotor of the form $R_xR_yR_z$.

\section*{Finding Euler Angles}

In this section we concern ourselves with the extrapolation of a set of Euler angles for
a given rotation axis order from a given unit-rotor $R$.  If one were to take a purely algebraic
approach to this problem, they would quickly arrive at an undetermined system of non-linear equations,
which seem quite intractable.  A different and perhaps better approach is to take what we know
about the application of Euler angles to come up with a solution to the problem.
Our approach here will be in terms of visualizing the original and final coordinate frames,
and to work by using the first two Euler angles to align a single axis.  The remaining Euler angle
will then rotate the two frames into complete alignment.  Clearly the axis we choose to align must
coincide with the same axis about which the final Euler angle will rotate.
