The Moral Force of Women -- Elder D. Todd Christofferson
========================================================

To generate the best discussion and understanding, the right questions have to be asked.  If I fail to ask the right questions about some of Elder Christofferson's talk, please speak up.

Read P1.

Ask: What is this "innate moral power" within women and why does society rely upon it?

Read P2.

Ask: Can anyone here attest to the moral influence that their Mother has had on them and explain how it has helped you become a better person?

Thought: It's probably no accident that Mothers are stereotyped as being the parent who instils all sorts of morals and virtues in their children, such as, "Didn't your Mom teach you that it's no polite to pick your nose in public?", and "Didn't your Mom teach you to play nice with others?", and so on.  Mothers seem to shape their children in ways that Fathers don't or are not prone to.

Ask: How powerful is the moral influence of women?

Read P8-9.

Ask: Is it possible that we have sometimes taken for granted the moral influence of women?  If so, how?

Though: It's probably very easy to take for granted the positive moral influences of women, and the importance of such influences, when our society is bombarded with negative moral influences of women.

Read P11-12.

Ask: For those that have stay-at-home wives, has it been a sacrifice or struggle for one or both of you to make this arrangement?

Thought: Melinda doesn't seem to mind staying home with the kids.  Admittedly, I don't think I could handle it, and, quite frankly, neither could the kids.  Growing up, however, I remember how important it was for me personally that Mom was home when I got home from school.  I don't know how to explain it, but if Mom was home when I got home, it was a good day, and a bad day otherwise.

Read P13-14.

Ask: Does anyone have any thoughts about this?

Read P15-16.

Though: It's interesting to me to see how the world seems to glorify the opposite of what we know to be better traits in a person.  I think that this idea of making the bad seem good and good seem bad comes from the adversary.
