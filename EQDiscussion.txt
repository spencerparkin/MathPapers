Lamentations of Jeremiah: Beware of Bondage -- Elder Quentin L. Cook

 - Elder Cook talks a lot of about various types of bondage we can find ourselves in while also talking about the gathering of Israel.  Admittedly, I was confused for some time as to what these had to do with one another, but there may be an obvious answer.  So I wanted to ask: how are these two things related?
   - It might be fair to say that those without the restored gospel are in the bondage of not having the restored truths of the gospel.  See D&C 123:12, John 8:32 -- "The truth will make you free."  The commandments don't restrict us, they make us free from the consequences of sin.

 - So it makes sense now that Elder Cook begins his talk about bondage with the very antithesis of a restoration, which is an apostasy.  Specifically, he begins with the downfall of Jerusalem.  Read 7-10.
   - So the people at Jerusalem have chosen to reject the gospel and do whatever they want.  If they're just choosing to do whatever they want, why does this put them bondage?
     - John 8:34 -- "Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin."
   - The footnote of paragraph 10 is interesting.  Read footnote 7.  They had time to repent, but would not return to the Lord.  Are we making good use of our time?
   
 - Read 11-12.  So here Elder Cook talks about some types of bondages and their consequences.  It would seem to me that a common theme in all of these different types of bondages is a loss of free agency.
   - What is intellectual bondage?

     - I've been struggling with a caffeine addiction.  I can definitely see the bondage it has put me in.  I can't sleep and I can't run.
   - Read 20-21.
     - This is certainly a difficult one.  In our time, there are so many things competing for our time.  We have to make family a priority.  I have to admit to wanting to recreate too much and this can take me away from my family.
   - Read 22-23.
