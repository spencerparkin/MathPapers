we first must give usual metric on R^n as euclidean metric using norm in GA
assume the usual topology on R^n
build up the definition of what will become an integrable surface
define the integral over a surface
show that the integral is well defined (the integral is a function taking
the surface to integrate over and the function to integrate over the surface as arguments)


% space and structure on space.
% assume euclidean metric
% assume usual topology on R^n

% we'll want to integrate multivector-valued functions defined on the space over
% subsets of the space, but not just any subset is an integrable subset, nor
% is any function an integrable function.  those things need to be worked out.

% an integrable surface may need to be compact so that Henie-Borel principle works.
% this means that it contains all of its accumulation points.
% define what a tangent vector is to a subset of space.
% show that the set of all tangent vectors to a point in a subset of space
% forms a vector space.  a k-dim surface has a tangent space at every point that
% is of dimension k.

% an integration sequence is a sequence s_i of finite subsets of our integrable
% surface with the property that for any open set intersecting our surface,
% there exists j s.t. for all i >= j, s_i intersects the surface.
% with a compact surface, we can take any open covering, reduce it to a finite
% sub-cover, then show that there exists j s.t. for all i >= j, we have
% s_i intersecting every open set in the finite cover.

% concrete.  what constitutes this, that.  no lack of rigor.

% now try to define integral.  you must show that it is a well defined
% function of the integrable surface and the integrable function.

% we're not sufficiently nailed down until we have an FTC that
% gives us a way to evaluate integrals.
