Power in the Priesthood -- Elder Anderson

Ask: Concerning the role we play as bearers of the priesthood, who are the main beneficiaries of the priesthood and who is the benefactor?

When we're exercising our priesthood, I'm not sure that we land in either of these two categories.

Read paragraph 3.  The main beneficiaries are everyone.

Read paragraph 4.  Those exercising the priesthood are not the benefactors, they are the administrators.

It is probably not possible to successfully administer the blessings of the priesthood if we do not understand the principle that Elder Anderson is teaching us in paragraph 4.  When we give priesthood blessings, we are humbly seeking the will of Heavenly Father, that He may inspire and direct us.

Ask: How do members of a family have access to the blessings of the priesthood?

We, as fathers, have a responsibility to provide some access to priesthood blessings, but one of the messages of Elder Anderson's talk is that this is not the only access a family has to the priesthood, and this is especially comforting to families that lack a father worthy to exercise priesthood.

Ask: So if not by a priesthood blessing, how else might family members receive blessings of the priesthood?

Read paragraphs 5-7.

So we receive priesthood blessings by being obedient to covenants we have made in ordinances administered to us by the authority priesthood.

Ask: What are some manifestations of priesthood power and blessings in our lives that occur as we're obedient to our covenants?

Read paragraphs 8-9.

Ask: What set of circumstances must come together in order for there to be a real administration of priesthood blessings from one exercising priesthood authority to one seeking a priesthood blessing?

Read paragraphs 16-17.

Ask: What are the consequences of unworthily participating in a priesthood ordinance on either the administration end or the receiving end?

Read paragraph 22.  This was interesting to me.  I did not know this.

It's possible that through disobedience to the law of chastity and other commandments that we may be forfeiting certain spiritual gifts, without which, we cannot administer certain priesthood blessings.  We may then even come under condemnation for failing to administer priesthood blessings that we would otherwise have been able to administer.

Ask: How does one know that he is worthy to participate in a priesthood ordinance?  In other words, how far can a priesthood holder fall short of the commandment to be perfect, yet still be considered worthy to exercise the priesthood?

Ask: What kind of spiritual preparations need be made before a priesthood blessing be given?

Read paragraphs 23-24.

We never know when we may be called upon to give a priesthood blessing.

Ask: How do women contribute in the church if they do not hold the priesthood?

Read paragraphs 31-34.

In paragraphs 36 to 40, Elder Anderson tells a story about a mother who single handedly provided for the temporal and spiritual blessings of her children.  Because of her efforts, and despite the inactivity and unworthiness of the father in the priesthood, their home was filled with the blessings of priesthood power.

Ask: Why are priesthood blessings administered exclusively by men in the church?

Read reference 12.
