\section*{Understanding Example 7}

Let $R$ be the ring of all real-valued functions of a real variable.
The subset $S$ of all differentiable functions is a subgring of $R$
but not an ideal of $R$.

Let $f$ be any real-valued function of a real variable that is not differential and let $g$
be such a function that is differentiable.  Now notice that the
function $h(x)=f(x)g(x)$ is not differentiable.

\section*{Understanding Example 15}

If it can be shown that $A$ contains a non-zero real number $c$, then,
by virtue of being an ideal, it absorbs all elements of $R[x]$,
so all $f(x)c$ with $f(x)\in R[x]$ is all of $R[x]$, showing that $A=R[x]$.

\section*{Exercise 3}

Verify that the set $I$ in Example 5 is an ideal and that if $J$ is any ideal
of $R$ that contains $a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n$, then $I\subseteq J$.
(Hence, $\langle a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n\rangle$ is the smallest ideal of $R$
that contains $a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n$.)

For reference, note that
\begin{equation*}
I=\langle a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n\rangle=\{r_1a_1+r_2a_2+\dots+r_na_n|r_i\in R\}.
\end{equation*}

Clearly $0\in I$.  If $x,y\in I$, then for elements $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n\in R$
and elements $y_1,y_2,\dots,y_n\in R$, we have
\begin{align*}
x-y&=x_1a_1+x_2a_2+\dots+x_na_n-(y_1a_1+y_2a_2+\dots+y_na_n) \\
 &= (x_1-y_1)a_1+(x_2-y_2)a_2+\dots+(x_n-y_n)a_n \in I,
\end{align*}
since each $x_i-y_i\in R$.  Letting $r\in R$, we have
\begin{equation*}
rx = rx_1a_1+rx_2a_2+\dots+rx_na_n\in I,
\end{equation*}
since each $rx_i\in R$.

Now let $J$ be an ideal of $R$ containing $a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n$,
and let $x$ be any element of $I$.  As before, let $x=x_1a_1+x_2a_2+\dots+x_na_n$.
Now by the definition of what an ideal is, it is clear that each $x_ia_i\in J$, because
$x_i\in R$ and $a_i\in J$.  Furthermore, $x\in J$, because each $x_ia_i\in J$ and $J$ is a group.

\section*{Exercise 7}

Let $a$ belong to a commutative ring $R$.  Show that $aR=\{ar|r\in R\}$
is an ideal of $R$.  If $R$ is the ring of even integers, list the elements of $4R$.

Clearly the additive identity is in $aR$, since $0=a\cdot 0$.
Let $x,y\in aR$.  Then there exist elements $r_x,r_y\in R$ such that $x=ar_x$ and $y=ar_y$.
We then have $x-y=ar_x-ar_y=a(r_x-r_y)\in aR$ since $r_x-r_y\in R$.
Now let $r\in R$ and see that $rx=rar_x=arr_x\in aR$ since $rr_x\in R$.
It follows that $aR$ is an ideal of $R$.

In that case, $4R=\{0, \pm 8, \pm 16, \pm 24, \pm 32, \dots\}$, I think.

\section*{Exercise 9}

If $n$ is an integer greater than 1, show that $\langle n\rangle=nZ$ is a prime ideal of $Z$
if and only if $n$ is prime.

Notice that $nZ$ is an ideal of $Z$ by Exercise 7.

Suppose $n$ is prime.  Let $a,b\in Z$ such that $ab\in nZ$.
Then there exists $z\in Z$ such that $ab=nz$.  It follows
that $n|ab$ which implies that $n|a$ or $n|b$ by Euclid's Lemma.
So there exists $z'\in Z$ such that $a=nz'\in nZ$ or $b=nz'\in nZ$,
showing that $nZ$ is a prime ideal of $Z$.

Now suppose $nZ$ is a prime ideal of $Z$.
Then if $a,b\in Z$ such that $ab=nz$ for some $z\in Z$,
we must have, for some $z'\in Z$, $a=nz'$ or $b=nz'$.
In other words, if $n|ab$, we must have $n|a$ or $n|b$
in every case.  There is no composite number that can do this,
so $n$ must be prime.  (We can also conclude $n$ is prime
by continually factoring what $n$ divides, and then know that $n$
divides one of the factors.  Repeating, we're eventually left with only one prime factor.)

\section*{Exercise 15}

If $A$ is an ideal of a ring $R$ and 1 belongs to $A$, prove that $A=R$.

Since $A$ is an ideal of $R$ and $1\in A$, we have, for all $r\in R$, $r=1r\in A$,
showing that $A=R$.

\section*{Exercise 21}

Verify the claim made in Example 10 about the size of $R/I$.

For reference,
\begin{equation*}
R=\left\{\left.\left[\begin{array}{cc}a_1&a_2\\a_3&a_4\end{array}\right]\right|a_i\in Z\right\}
\end{equation*}
and $I$ is the subset of $R$ consisting of matrices with even entries.

The example in the text helps make the verification easy.  Let $M\in R$.
Then the coset $M+I=B+I$, where $B$ is a matrix consisting of just ones
and zeros.  Since the matrices have 4 possible entries, there are $2^4=16$
possible elements in $R/I$.

\section*{Exercise 23}

Show that the set $B$ in the latter half of the proof of Theorem 14.4 is an
ideal of $R$.

For reference, $B=\{br+c|r\in R, a\in A\}$ with $b\in R-A$.  The subset $A$ is an ideal
of $R$, and $R$ is a commutative ring with unity.

Letting $x\in R$, we must show that for any $y\in B$, that $xy\in B$ and $yx\in B$.
Let $y=br+a$ for elements $r\in R$ and $a\in A$.
Then $xy=bxr+xa\in B$ since $xr\in R$ and $xa\in A$.  (Remember that $A$ is
an ideal of $R$.)  And we have $yx=bry+ay\in B$ since $ry\in R$ and $ay\in A$.
