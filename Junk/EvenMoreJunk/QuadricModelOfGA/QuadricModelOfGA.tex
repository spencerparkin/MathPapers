\section{Finding The Quadric Equation}

Taking our cue from \cite{WikipediaQuadricEntry}, the $n$-dimensional quadric surfaces
may be characterized as the set of all projective points in an $(n+1)$-dimensional homogeneous space
satisfying a matrix equation involving a symmetric matrix.  We will let $\V^{n+1}$ be an
$(n+1)$-dimensional vector space and identify vectors in this space with projective
points of $n$-dimensional space in the usual manner.  That is, letting $\{e_i\}_{i=0}^n$
be an orthonormal basis for $\V^{n+1}$, we identify the $n$-dimensional point
represented by any $p\in\V^{n+1}$ as the point $p/(p\cdot e_0)$ in the $e_0=1$ plane,
provided $p\cdot e_0\neq 0$.

Letting $\{\alpha_{ij}\}\subset\R$ with $0\leq i\leq j\leq n$ be the scalar elements of a symmetric
matrix $M$, an $n$-dimensional quadric surface is the projective solution set to the
matrix equation
\begin{equation}\label{equ_quadric_matrix_equation}
0 = pMp^\intercal,
\end{equation}
where here we have abused notation by interpreting the vector $p$ taken from $\V^{n+1}$ as
a row-vector with $p^\intercal$ as the corresponding column-vector, and where $M$ is the
$(n+1)\times(n+1)$ symmetric matrix given by
\begin{equation}
\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\alpha_{00} & \alpha_{01} & \dots & \alpha_{0n} \\
\alpha_{01} & \alpha_{11} & \dots & \alpha_{1n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\alpha_{0n} & \alpha_{1n} & \dots & \alpha_{nn}
\end{array}\right].
\end{equation}
Written another way without abusing notation, we have
\begin{equation}\label{equ_lowlevel_equation}
0 = \sum_{i=0}^n\sum_{j=i}^n\sigma_{ij}\alpha_{ij}(p\cdot e_i)(p\cdot e_j),
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{ij}$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{ij} = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
1 & \mbox{if $i=j$,} \\
2 & \mbox{if $i\neq j$.}
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
The form \eqref{equ_quadric_matrix_equation} lends itself to the study
of quadrics using matrix algebra, while the form \eqref{equ_lowlevel_equation}
may be thought of as a low-level form of the equation in geometric algebra.
What we might think of as a high-level form in geometric algebra, coming from
a framework of computation, may provide a better means of studying quadrics
using geometric algebra.  We proceed now to develop such a form.

Let $\W^{2(n+1)}$ denote a $2(n+1)$-dimensional vector space
having $\{e_i\}_{i=0}^{2n+1}$ as a set of orthonormal basis vectors
generating it.  The vector space $\V^{n+1}$ is therefore a vector
sub-space of $\W^{2(n+1)}$ and we will let $\Vb^{n+1}$ denote
the $(n+1)$-dimensional vector sub-space of $\W^{2(n+1)}$ that
is complement to $\V^{n+1}$.  It is then helpful to introduce the
notation $\overline{p}$ as the vector in $\Vb^{n+1}$ related to the
vector $p\in\V^{n+1}$ by the equation
\begin{equation}
\overline{p} = Rp\tilde{R},
\end{equation}
where $R$ is a rotor defined as
\begin{equation}
R = 2^{-n/2}\prod_{i=0}^n\left(1-e_ie_{i+n+1}\right).
\end{equation}
This idea comes from \cite{DoranHestenes93}, and it is easy to see
that for any integer $i\in[0,n]$, we have $\overline{e}_i=e_{i+n+1}$
and $\overline{e}_{i+n+1}=e_i$.  Notice that the over-bar operator
is also an outermorphic function that we may apply to any element
of the geometric algebra $\G(\W^{2(n+1)})$.

We are now ready to give the high-level form of equation \eqref{equ_lowlevel_equation}
as\footnote{Here and throughout this paper, we assume that the outer product takes
precedence over the inner product.  We also assume that the geometric product takes
precedence over the inner and outer products.}
\begin{equation}\label{equ_highlevel_equation}
0 = p\wedge\overline{p}\cdot B,
\end{equation}
where $B\in\G(\W^{2(n+1)})$ is a bivector of the form
\begin{equation}\label{equ_quadric_bivector_form}
B = -\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=0}^n\sum_{j=i}^n\alpha_{ij}(e_i\overline{e}_j+(-1)^{\sigma_{ij}}\overline{e}_ie_j).
\end{equation}
Here, as in the form \eqref{equ_quadric_matrix_equation} where we may think of
the symmetric matrix as representative of the quadric, the bivector $B$ may also be thought
of as a quadric representative.  Of course, some bivectors cannot be written
in the form of equation \eqref{equ_quadric_bivector_form}, but such bivectors
clearly still give a quadric when plugged into equation \eqref{equ_highlevel_equation}.

While realizing that we need to be careful, because the inner product is not associative,
it is interesting to write equation \eqref{equ_highlevel_equation} in a form
similar to that of equation \eqref{equ_quadric_matrix_equation}.  Doing so, we get
\begin{equation}\label{equ_conjugation_form}
0 = p\cdot B\cdot\overline{p}.
\end{equation}
We can get away with this, because the choice of associativity here only changes
the sign of the right-hand side, and the sign of the left-hand side clearly doesn't matter.
Considering $\overline{p}$ a type of conjugate to $p$, we may refer to equation
\eqref{equ_conjugation_form} as the inner product conjugation of $B$ by $p$.

\section{Using The Quadric Equation}

Having developed the quadric equation \eqref{equ_highlevel_equation} in geometric algebra, we can
now benefit from the language of geometric algebra in using it to answer questions about quadric geometry.

Notice that in our model we can make a distinction between members of $\V^{n+1}$ that are
representative of points and those representative of directions.  Specifically, a vector $v\in\V^{n+1}$
is a direction if and only if $v\cdot e_0=0$.  Although we will use an arrow accent to distinguish
between direction vectors and position vectors, there should be no confusion on the form
of a vector and what we intend it to represent when we refer to it as a direction or a position.
Similarly, we will take the liberty of referring to bivectors taken
from $\G(\V^{2(n+1)})$ as quadrics.  This helps eliminate phrases that would otherwise sound a bit
too pedantic.

\subsection{Characterizing Flat Quadrics}

Letting $f:\V^{n+1}\to\R$ be the function defined as
\begin{equation}
f(x) = x\wedge\overline{x}\cdot B,
\end{equation}
we arrive at our first result.
\begin{lemma}\label{lma_flat_quadric}
Given any quadric $B$, if for all pairs of homogenized points $p,x\in\V^{n+1}$ on $B$
we have $f(x-p)=0$, then $B$ is a linear (flat) quadric.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
For any pair of homogenized points $p,x\in\V^{n+1}$, there is a direction $\vec{x}\in\V^{n+1}$
such that $x=p+\vec{x}$.  We then find that
\begin{equation}
f(x) = f(p+\vec{x}) = f(p) + \nabla_{\vec{x}}f(p) + f(x-p) = \nabla_{\vec{x}}f(p),
\end{equation}
in the case that $p$ is on $B$, where $\nabla_{\vec{x}}f(p)$ is the directional
derivative of $f$ at $p$ in the direction of $\vec{x}$.  It follows that the tangent
space of any point on the quadric is also in the quadric.  The quadric is therefore
flat at any point upon its surface.  To see this, consider all such pairs of points $p,x$ where
both are on $B$.  Both are on $B$ and both are in the tangent space of $B$ at $p$.
\end{proof}
Recalling that for any $x\in\V^{n+1}$, the definition of $\nabla f(x)$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\nabla f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^n e_i\nabla_{e_i}f(x),
\end{equation}
it is not hard to show that for any vector $y\in\V^{n+1}$, we have
$y\cdot\nabla f(x)=\nabla_y f(x)$.  Seeing that $\vec{x}\cdot\nabla f(p)=\nabla_{\vec{x}}f(p)$
in the light of Lemma~\ref{lma_flat_quadric},
it follows that the direction $e_0\cdot e_0\wedge\nabla f(p)$
is normal to the surface of the quadric $B$ at $p$.

\subsection{Quadric 2-Blades}

All quadrics are bivectors, but not all bivectors are 2-blades.  Here
we study the class of quadrics that are 2-blades.  For any four
vectors $a,b,c,d\in\V^{n+1}$, such a quadric $B$ has the form
\begin{align}
B &= (a+\overline{b})\wedge(c+\overline{d})\label{equ_quadric_twoblade} \\
 &= a\wedge c + a\wedge\overline{d} + \overline{b}\wedge c + \overline{b\wedge d}.\label{equ_quadric_twoblade_expanded}
\end{align}
Further restricting the type of bivector studied here,
it is curious to think what geometric significance the quadric $B$ has in relation
to these four vectors when assumed to be projective points.  Whatever the case may be, it is clear from equation
\eqref{equ_quadric_twoblade_expanded} that the quadric $B$ contains the intersection, if any,
of the four quadrics appearing in the sum.  Considering the three forms of 2-blades
found in the expansion of equation \eqref{equ_quadric_twoblade} to be more
fundamental, (namely, $a\wedge c$, $\overline{b\wedge d}$ and
the identical forms $a\wedge\overline{d}$ and $-c\wedge\overline{b}$), we'll
start with a treatment of each of these forms.

We first notice that the quadrics of the form $a\wedge c$ and $\overline{b\wedge d}$
trivially represent the quadric of all space.  They therefore contribute nothing
to the shape of $B$.  The remaining form $a\wedge\overline{d}$, therefore,
deserves our full attention.  We break this form into two cases, the first being
the case when $a=d$, and the second when $a\neq d$.

In the first case, an application of equation
\eqref{equ_highlevel_equation} easily reveals the type of quadric
represented by $a\wedge\overline{a}$.  Doing so, we see that it represents
the set of all projective points $p\in\V^{n+1}$ such that
\begin{equation}\label{equ_point_or_plane_blade}
0=p\wedge\overline{p}\cdot a\wedge\overline{a}=-(p\cdot a)^2,
\end{equation}
which holds if and only if $p\cdot a=0$.
Letting $p=e_0+\vec{p}$ and $a=e_0+\vec{a}$, equation \eqref{equ_point_or_plane_blade} becomes
\begin{equation}
-1 = \vec{p}\cdot\vec{a} = \langle \vec{p}\vec{a}\rangle_0,
\end{equation}
where it is clear that $a\wedge\overline{a}$ is the solitary projective point
$e_0-\vec{a}^{-1}$ in the case that $a$ is a projective point.\footnote{What is perhaps unfortunate is
that this also means that the element $p\wedge\overline{p}$ does not
represent the projective point $p$ as we might like to think of it
in the context of equation \eqref{equ_highlevel_equation}.
That is, while $0=p\wedge\overline{p}\cdot B$ implies that the
projective point $p$ is on $B$, it does not imply that the point $p\wedge\overline{p}$
is on $B$ under the definition implied by equation \eqref{equ_highlevel_equation}
of what $p\wedge\overline{p}$ represents.  We therefore have to be careful with
our manner of speech when we refer to any element as representing any particular geometry.
The definition under which that element is representative of a geometry must always be known.}
In the case that $a$ is a direction, equation \eqref{equ_point_or_plane_blade} becomes
\begin{equation}
0 = \vec{p}\cdot\vec{a},
\end{equation}
showing that in this case, $a\wedge\overline{a}$ is the plane containing
the origin and having $\vec{a}$ as a vector normal to its surface.

%\footnote{At this point we are able to see that there may be a new
%and significant interpretation to equation \eqref{equ_highlevel_equation}
%in the realization that $p\wedge\overline{p}$ is itself a point.  Specifically,
%this brings up the question: if $A$ and $B$ are quadrics, what geometric
%relation can we draw between these two quadrics in the case that
%$A\cdot B=0$?  Clearly, we already know that the general
%quadric $B$ is characterized by the set of all points satisfying
%the condition of this relationship, whatever this relationship may be.}

In the second case, our use of equation \eqref{equ_highlevel_equation} barrows
from what we have just learned in the first case.
\begin{equation}
0 = p\wedge\overline{p}\cdot a\wedge\overline{d} = -(p\cdot a)(p\cdot d)
\end{equation}
Clearly this represents the union of any combination of a pair geometries where either
one is a point or a plane containing the origin.  Interestingly, in the case of a
point-plane pair, the point need not be on the plane.

Returning to the general quadric 2-blade \eqref{equ_quadric_twoblade}, to understand
this general form, we must come to some understanding of...


% Formulate a sphere.  Can we do stuff with spheres, points and planes?

% Can we apply the lemma to 2-blade quadrics?

% Can we formulate quadrics in terms of a center point?
% How do you define or find the center of a quadric?

\subsection{Exploiting The Entire Algebra}

It should be observed that a bivector is not the sole form of an
element of our geometric algebra that is capable of representing
a quadric.  Indeed, any element of the algebra can represent a quadric,
because all of the necessary mixing of coordinates is done in the
$p\wedge\overline{p}$ calculation, while the quadric representative
$B$, not necessarily a bivector, contains nothing more than the coefficients characterizing the quadric.
A formal definition of the desired algebraic variety is now warranted.
\begin{definition}\label{def_quadric_variety}
For any element $E\in\G(\V^{2(n+1)})$, this element is representative of the
geometry that is the set of all projective points $p\in\V^{n+1}$ such that
\begin{equation}
0=p\wedge\overline{p}\cdot E.
\end{equation}
\end{definition}
From the beginning of this paper we have been using the version of
Definition~\ref{def_quadric_variety} where $E$ is strictly a bivector.  We will now consider
some cases where $E$ is not a bivector.

The first consideration is naturally that of vectors.  Letting $a,b\in\V^{n+1}$ be any two
vectors, we see that
\begin{equation}
p\wedge\overline{p}\cdot(a+\overline{b}) = (p\cdot b)p - (p\cdot a)\overline{p}.
\end{equation}
Recalling that if $p$ is a projective point, then $p\neq 0$, it is clear that $p$ is on $a+\overline{b}$
if and only if $p\cdot a=0$ and $p\cdot b=0$.
Blah blah.\footnote{Notice that we must be careful here in referring to a
vector as any geometry.  For example, it is common for us to think of a vector $p\in\V^{n+1}$
as a projective point, but under Definition~\ref{def_quadric_variety}, $p$ represents the projective
point $e_0-(e_0\cdot (e_0\wedge p))^{-1}$.}

General trivectors are as formidable an object of study as bivectors themselves.
Let us therefore consider cases of trivectors that we can relate back to what
we already know about bivectors.

\section{Concluding Remarks}

Admittedly, more questions have been brought up than answered in this paper.
It also appears that while the equation \eqref{equ_highlevel_equation}
works as an alternative to the matrix equation \eqref{equ_quadric_matrix_equation},
it may prove to be nothing more than a curious mathematical construction.  If there are
any new insights to be gained about quadrics using geometric algebra, I have no idea
if this model can be helpful in that regard.
